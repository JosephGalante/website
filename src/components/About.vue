    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, earning degrees
        in both Computer Science and Finance. I'm ready to apply my knowledge
        and skills to make a positive impact in the world. My passion for
        technology and drive to succeed are matched by my love for adventure and
        the great outdoors. As an avid rock climber, I am always seeking new
        challenges and thrills in the natural world.

        Additionally, my love for music is an integral part of my life. I have
        been playing guitar and bass for many years, and find great joy in
        making music. I am currently employed as a software engineer at Edge
        Case Research, where I am able to continue to learn and grow in my
        field. My passion for learning and exploring extends beyond my
        professional life, as I am a dedicated traveler. I recently spent an
        unforgettable summer backpacking solo through Europe, and am always
        eager to discover new places and cultures.
